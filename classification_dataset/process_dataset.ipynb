    "This script processes a specified folder of .jpg images by copying and renaming the images, detecting faces within each image, and then grouping the detected faces by individual. Each unique person is identified based on facial encodings, allowing for grouped classification of images by person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage Instructions:\n",
    "1. Specify the path to the source images folder containing .jpg files only.\n",
    "2. The script will output renamed images, cropped faces, and grouped folders for each identified individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING:\n",
    "Ensure the source images folder contains ONLY .jpg files. Other formats are not supported and may cause errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process Overview:\n",
    "- Step 1: `copy_and_rename_files` - Copies images from the source folder to a temporary folder, renaming them sequentially.\n",
    "- Step 2: `create_faces_folder` - Detects and crops faces from each renamed image, saving individual face images.\n",
    "- Step 3: `group_faces` - Groups face images by individual based on facial encoding comparisons and saves each group to a separate folder.\n"
